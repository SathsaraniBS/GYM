    text: "Used this gym on a day membership (500 Rupees). staff are great. Helped me figuring out the treadmill. Even gave directions to the gym from my home. Gym has A/C and a good vibe. The only minor issue is that treadmills have a time limit of 20 minutes. Although, I can understand the need for it, especially during peak times."
